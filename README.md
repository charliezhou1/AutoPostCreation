# AutoPostCreation

This project is to build an AI-powered content generator using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with OpenAI GPT-4, LangChain, and LlamaIndex. It reads corporate reports from a directory, processes them with embeddings and LLMs, and outputs auto-generated content (e.g., LinkedIn posts or summaries).
